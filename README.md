About:
- This is an web quiz game built with React.
- The page switching is made with UseState, with a state for each page.
- The configurations set in the options screen are stored with Redux (I never used Redux before)
- The app gets a specific amount of random questions from the Open Trivia Database, an API with questions.
- The API allows to get questions filtering the category, type and difficulty but I choose to not using this feature due to the lack of questions in some requests.

Future Plans:
- I'm planning to implement more features in the UI, like animations in the background.
- I'm also thinking about game modes, with chronometers and health system (you lose HP with misses)
- For the above, I would use a database like Firebase or MongoDB

Current Problems:
- Some questions may appear out of the boxes
- Some special characters are not rendering right, turning the phrases weird
- Some problems with sizes may appear

Building Process:

- I started this project after seeing a post on Instagram (@onebitcode) with ideas for web projects
- I liked the idea of building a quiz and started to design it with Figma
- It was meant to have an 8-bit design, with pixels and things like that.
- So I built and rebuilt the quiz again and again, but was never satisfied
- Each time I used a different approach going from "completely nonsense" to "organized"
- By the way I started to learn Redux in this project, when I needed a global state
- On the last approach I decided to follow some React pattern and choose the Fractal Structure (personal taste)
- I liked the code, but didn't liek the design, then I rebuilt it one more time with a new font, a new ui, new colors...
- At the end I finally liked the design and now I'm just fixing some bugs and thinking about new features
- * I used CodeSandBox and VS Code as IDEs
